This is a research project that I and few groupmates did over winter break December 2023 - Febuary 2024 in a program called Undergraduate Research Program. We selected two regions from electricymaps.com, using those two regions we went to each respective website and collected data using web scraping collecting the energy mix from each region. We then cleaned the data collected by making a uniform data file that looks the same for both regions. With the cleaned file we then made bar/pie charts to then analyze the collected data.
